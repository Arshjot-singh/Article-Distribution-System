The Game of Gentlemen

Beneath the sun on grassy green,
A battle starts, both sharp and keen.
The bowler runs with fierce intent,
The batsman stands, his body bent.

A crack! The ball goes soaring high,
It dances boldly in the sky.
The crowd erupts with cheers and cries,
As fielders chase with focused eyes.

Spins and swings, a tricky play,
Each over carves a brand-new way.
From yorkers bold to sixes grand,
The match unfolds, both planned and planned.

With bat and ball, both skill and heart,
Each player plays a vital part.
In cricket’s charm, we all unite—
A timeless game, pure thrill and fight.
